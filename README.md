# hook-line-key
is a game about fishing.

You've dropped your key into a deep, deep lake, and must progressively reach deeper and deeper down in order to fish it back up.

On the way you fish up numerous items. Can you collect all 20?


Easily the messiest project I've ever written, but also my first ever game in Godot. Go easy.
